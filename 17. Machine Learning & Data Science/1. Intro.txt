AI - (Artificial Intelligence) Machine which act like human intelligence .
Machine Learning(ML) is a subset of AI. is an approach to try and achieve ai through system that can find system and set of data.
Deep Learning - is one of the technique of ML. think it like a algorithm
Data science - Analyze the data and create a business sort decisions. ML and DS both are overlapping fields.

---------------------------

How Machine Learning work-
when we give some input and do some ops then we get output so its general thing.
But in ML we give input and output as well and ML creates a model/algorithm/bot.. which save all the data we trained to model.
one line - We use MLto predict future according to data.

----------------------------

Data - data is everywhere. companies collects billions of user data through csv,excel, RDBMS(MySql, Oracle), Document DB(MOngoDB). and then they use their data to ML model topredict and forecast future business goal.

----------------------------

Types of Machine Learning

(1) Supervised ML- predict future according to labeled data. Ex.(1) csv files which have categories. (2) classification - make aline between apple and banana in picture (3) Regression - analysis of stock market.

(2) Unsupervised ML- predict according to the unlabeled data Ex (1) csv files but dont have categories. (2) clustering and Association Rule Learning are there.

(3) Reinforcement - train model using real time learning, skill acquisition

------------------------------

Machine learning workflow
#1- Import the data.
#2- Clean the data.
#3- Split data. Training data/Test data.
#4- Create Model.
#5- Check the output.
#6- Improve.
