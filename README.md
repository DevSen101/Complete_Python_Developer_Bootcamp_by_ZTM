 ## Python: From Fundamentals to Real-World Applications

This repository documents my journey of learning **Python from scratch to advanced**, with a strong focus on **understanding concepts, writing clean code, and building real-world projects**.

Instead of rushing to publish incomplete work, I spent time learning independently, practicing consistently, and committing meaningful progress (**50+ commits**).
Now, I’m sharing this repository to **serve the community and help others learn better**.

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Machine Learning & Data Science

In this section, I worked on foundational machine learning concepts by applying the complete ML workflow on real datasets using Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda.

🔹 Dataset 1: Iris Flower Dataset

Imported the dataset

Cleaned and explored the data

Split data into training and test sets

Created a machine learning model

Evaluated model performance

Improved results through iteration

This project helped me understand how ML models are built from scratch, not just how to call libraries.

🔹 Dataset 2: Soccer 2019 Dataset (Data Visualization)

Loaded and explored the dataset

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing

Visualized insights from the 2019 soccer dataset

Used plots to understand patterns and trends in the data

This project focused on data analysis and visualization, improving my ability to interpret real-world datasets.
Additional work:

* Built a **Smart Brain project** to analyze images

---

## 📌 Learning Approach

* Learn concepts deeply before using libraries
* Write clean, readable code
* Build projects to reinforce understanding
* Share knowledge openly

Each project will be shared with **proper explanations and demo videos** over time.
