# four pillars of OOps

# (1) Encapsulation
#  Bundles data (attributes) and methods into a class, restricting direct access to some components via private attributes (e.g., using single underscore _ or double __) to protect integrity and expose controlled interfaces


# (2)Abstraction
# Hides complex implementation details, showing only essential features through abstract base classes (via abc module) or interfaces
# public and private variables

# _age is private variable. it starts with underscore its not python convention but its programmer convention(in java we have private var)


# (3) Inheritance
# Allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class, promoting code reuse 
# (e.g., class Child(Parent)

# isinstance(instance, Class) - to ckeck that is this is a instance of Class
# 

# (4) Polymorphism
# Enables objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably via method overriding or duck typing (e.g., same method name behaves differently across classes
