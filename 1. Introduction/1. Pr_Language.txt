* A programming language is a way to give instructions to a computer.
* Without programs, computers cannot do anything (mouse, internet, apps, games).
* Computers do not understand human languages like English.
* Computers understand only **binary**: `0` and `1` (off/on).

**Why programming languages exist**

* Writing only `0` and `1` is difficult for humans.
* Programming languages act as a bridge between humans and machines.

**Types of programming languages**

* **Low-level languages**: Closer to machine language

  * Example: Assembly
* **High-level languages**: Closer to human language

  * Examples: Python, JavaScript, Java

**Source Code**

* Code written by humans in languages like Python or JavaScript.
* Saved in files (e.g., `.py`, `.js`).

**Translator (Very Important)**

* Source code must be converted into machine code.
* This is done by another program called a **translator**.

**Types of Translators**

1. **Interpreter**

   * Translates and executes code **line by line**
   * Example: Python (mostly)
2. **Compiler**

   * Translates the **entire program at once**
   * Produces a binary file
   * Executes the whole program together

**Key Difference**

* Interpreter: line by line execution
* Compiler: whole file converted and executed at once

**Important Point**

* You cannot write Python code anywhere and expect it to run.
* You must install Python (the interpreter) on your computer.
* The interpreter translates your Python code into machine-understandable code.

**Conclusion**

* Humans write readable code.
* Interpreter or compiler translates it.
* Machine executes it.
