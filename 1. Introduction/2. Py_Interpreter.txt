* A programming language gives instructions to a computer using a **translator**.
* Translator can be an **interpreter** or a **compiler**.
* Python uses an **interpreter**.

**Important Idea**

* Python (the language) is **not a program**.
* Python is a **specification** (rules of how the language works).
* A real program must follow these rules to run Python code.

**Why we download Python**

* To run Python code, we need a **translator program**.
* This translator reads our Python source code and runs it on the machine.

**Python Implementation**

* When people say “Python”, they usually mean **CPython**.
* **CPython**:

  * Written in the **C language**
  * Official and most commonly used Python interpreter
  * Downloads from python.org give you CPython

**Other Python Implementations**

* **Jython** – written in Java
* **PyPy** – written in Python
* **IronPython** – built for .NET
* All follow the same Python rules but are built differently.

**What happens when Python runs**

1. You write Python code (source code)
2. CPython interpreter reads it line by line
3. Code is converted into **bytecode**
4. Bytecode runs on the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**
5. Output appears on your computer

**Key Points**

* Bytecode is closer to machine language
* Conversion happens automatically (you don’t see it)
* This process runs on computers, laptops, and phones

**Interview Note**

* You are rarely asked this in interviews
* This knowledge is for **understanding**, not memorization

**Conclusion**

* Python code → Interpreter → Bytecode → Virtual Machine → Output
* Downloading Python = downloading the interpreter + virtual machine
